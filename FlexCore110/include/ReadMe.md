<NvFlexExt.h>

More info:

The web addresses contain the bare code. Simply copy paste paste this code into new respective ".h" files.

If the above web addresses do not exist anymore try the following:<p>
1. Simply google "NvFlex.h" and "NvFlexExt.h" and see if you can find the header files. But you have to make sure that the header files refer to NVidia Flex version 1.1.0<p>
